Problem-1: Find the expected number of passes, comparisons and exchanges
for bubble results with the actual number of operations when the given
sequence is as follows: 7, 1, 3, 4, 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2.

Problem-2: Here is an array of ten integers: 5 3 8 9 1 7 0 2 6 4
Suppose we partition this array using quicksort&#39;s partition function and using 5 for the
pivot. Draw the resulting array after the partition finishes.

Problem-3: Sort the sequence 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5 using insertion sort.

Problem-4:.
Search element: 57

Problem-5: Given an array consisting of integers. The main task is to find the largest sub-
array in the given array, Which is sorted . But ,if the given array is not sorted , our task is to
divide the array into halves(exactly from between) and check the corresponding two halves
for sorting. We aim to find the length of the largest sorted array possible from the given
unsorted array with the condition mentioned. Example: 12,56,8,9,34,-1,0,4,32,8.

Problem-6: Given an array A[0,……,n-1] of n numbers containing the repetition of some
number. Give an algorithm for checking whether there are repeated elements are not. Assume
that we are not allowed to use additional space(we can use a few temporary variables,O(1)
storage.

Problem-7: Given an array A[0,……,n-1], where each element of the array represents a vote
in the election. Assume that each vote is given as an integer representing the ID of the chosen
candidate. Give an algorithm for determining who wins the election. Example :A[10, 12, 1,
14, 6, 5, 8, 15, 3, 9, 7, 4, 11, 13, 2].

Problem-8: Develop an algorithm for Quick Sort and trace the steps for sorting the following
list, and derive the time complexity. 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 60, 55, 50, 45.

Problem-9: Sort the elements 77,49,25,12,9,33,56,81 use the below sorting techniques
(i) Insertion sort (ii) selection sort (iii) bubble sort

Problem-10: Construct the Selection Sort and trace the iterations for sorting the following
list 136, 487, 358, 469, 570, 247, 598, 639, 205, 609.
